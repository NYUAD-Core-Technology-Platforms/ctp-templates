# Layouts

::subtitle::
Four reusable slide shapes, pick the one that fits the idea.

layout: default

# The default layout

Everyday slides use `layout: default`. You get a body slot and a footer with the deck title, author, and page number.

- Bullets render with accent markers
- `inline code` gets a soft warm background
- [Links](https://sli.dev) inherit the brand color

<CtpCallout label="Tip">
Speaker notes go inside an HTML comment under the slide content. See the source of this file.
</CtpCallout>

<!--
This is what speaker notes look like. They show up in the presenter view but
not the audience view. Use them liberally, your future self will thank you.

layout: two-cols-header

# Two columns with a shared header

::left::

### Left column

Use this layout when you want to compare or contrast two things side by side.

- Item A
- Item B
- Item C

::right::

### Right column

The header spans both columns. The columns share a vertical rule by default.

```ts
// Code blocks render the same in either column
const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b
```

# Components

::subtitle::
Auto-imported Vue components ready to drop into any slide.

# Components: callouts and chips

A `<CtpCallout>` for emphasis:

<CtpCallout label="Watch out" tone="accent">
Don't commit `node_modules` to git. The <code>.gitignore</code> in this repo already excludes it.
</CtpCallout>

Keyboard shortcuts with `<CtpKbd>`:

Press <CtpKbd>Cmd</CtpKbd> + <CtpKbd>K</CtpKbd> in the Slidev UI to open the slide navigator.

Inline brand tags: <span class="ctp-tag">Required</span> &nbsp; <span class="ctp-tag ctp-tag--accent">Optional</span>

# Code samples

```ts {monaco}
// Slidev highlights with Shiki by default. Add `{monaco}` to make a block editable.
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('CTP'))
```

Line highlighting works too:

```ts {2-3}
function fib(n: number): number {
  if (n < 2) return n
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
```
